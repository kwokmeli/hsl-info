## UW Health Sciences Library Helper

### About
With the UW Health Sciences Library Helper, you can search for librarians and their contact information by name or by topics that they are a liaison for. You can also search for the opening hours of the library.

### Usage
To ask for hours:
- “Will the library be open tomorrow?”, “Is the library open on October 31st?”, “Are you open right now?”, “Will you be open this weekend?”, etc.

To find a librarian:
- Search for a librarian by name: “Who is Sarah?”, “Who is John?”, “Who is Joanne?”, etc.
- Search for a librarian by topic: “Who is the liaison for oncology?”, “Who is a liaison for the topic of animal welfare?”, etc.

To find a librarian’s information:
- “Give me Stephen’s e-mail address”, “What topics is Sarah Safranek a liaison for?”, “Tell me about Tania”, “What is Joanne’s phone number?”, etc.
- If a librarian has already been found, you can say: “Tell me more”, “Tell me his/her e-mail”, “What is her phone number?”, etc. instead of their full name.

To start a new search for a librarian (you will be unable to use unnamed commands such as “Tell me his/her e-mail” until you find another librarian):
- “Start over” or simply ask for a new librarian (e.g. “Who is Emily?”, “Who is the liaison for biophysics?”).

### Known Issues
- Asking "Is the library open {season}" only works if {season} is "this fall", "next winter", "next fall", "next spring", or "next summer" (i.e. "this winter", "this spring", and "this summer" do not work).
- Requesting topics that are acronyms (e.g. "Who is the liaison for W.W.A.M.I.?") or extremely long (e.g. "Who is the liaison for The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation") occasionally do not work.

### Future Additions
- Search the PubMed database by topic, and have selected articles sent to your e-mail.
