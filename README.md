## UW Health Sciences Library Helper

### About
With the UW Health Sciences Library Helper, you can search for librarians and their contact information by name or by topics that they are a liaison for. You can also search for the opening hours of the library.

To ask for hours:
- “Will the library be open tomorrow?”, “Is the library open on October 31st?”, “Are you open right now?”, “Will you be open this weekend?”, etc.

To find a librarian:
- Search for a librarian by name: “Who is Sarah?”, “Who is John?”, “Who is Joanne?”, etc.
- Search for a librarian by topic: “Who is the liaison for oncology?”, “Who is a liaison for the topic of animal welfare?”, etc.

To find a librarian’s information:
- “Give me Stephen’s e-mail address”, “What topics is Sarah Safranek a liaison for?”, “Tell me about Tania”, “What is Joanne’s phone number?”, etc.
- If a librarian has already been found, you can say: “Tell me more”, “Tell me his/her e-mail”, “What is her phone number?”, etc. instead of their full name.

To start a new search for a librarian (you will be unable to use unnamed commands such as “Tell me his/her e-mail” until you find another librarian):
- “Start over” or simply ask for a new librarian (e.g. “Who is Emily?”, “Who is the liaison for biophysics?”, etc.)
